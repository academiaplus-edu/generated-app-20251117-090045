      { type: 'p', text: 'Navigating the academic publishing landscape can be a formidable challenge. After months, or even years, of dedicated research, a rejection from a target journal can be disheartening. However, understanding the common reasons for manuscript rejection is the first and most critical step toward improving your work and increasing your chances of publication success. Most rejections are not about the quality of the idea but the quality of its presentation. Here are ten common reasons manuscripts face rejection.' },
      { type: 'h2', text: '1. Mismatch with Journal Scope' },
      { type: 'p', text: 'This is one of the most frequent and easily avoidable reasons for a desk rejection. Every journal has a specific scope and audience. Submitting a paper on social science methodology to a clinical psychology journal, for instance, is a surefire way to get rejected without review. Always read the journal\'s "Aims and Scope" section carefully.' },
      { type: 'h2', text: '2. Weak Introduction and Unclear Research Question' },
      { type: 'p', text: 'The introduction must clearly establish the research gap and state the paper\'s purpose. If the editor cannot quickly grasp what your paper is about and why it is important, they are unlikely to send it for review. Your research question should be focused, clear, and compelling.' },
      { type: 'h2', text: '3. Inadequate Literature Review' },
      { type: 'p', text: 'A literature review that is outdated, incomplete, or fails to situate your work within the current academic conversation signals a lack of scholarly rigor. It must demonstrate that you have a deep understanding of the field and that your research makes a novel contribution.' },
      { type: 'h2', text: '4. Flawed Methodology' },
      { type: 'p', text: 'Reviewers will meticulously scrutinize your methodology. Flaws such as an inappropriate research design, a sample size that is too small, or the use of incorrect statistical tests will lead to rejection. Your methods must be robust, well-documented, and appropriate for answering your research question.' },
      { type: 'h2', text: '5. Lack of a Clear Contribution' },
      { type: 'p', text: 'Your paper must offer a clear, significant, and original contribution to the field. If your findings are merely incremental or do not advance the existing literature in a meaningful way, the paper is likely to be rejected. Be explicit about what is new and important about your work.' },
      { type: 'h2', text: '6. Poor Writing and Language' },
      { type: 'p', text: 'Numerous grammatical errors, typos, and awkward phrasing can obscure your message and lead to rejection. The writing must be clear, concise, and professional. For non-native English speakers, professional language polishing is often a crucial step.' },
      { type: 'h2', text: '7. Failure to Follow Journal Guidelines' },
      { type: 'p', text: 'Journals have very specific formatting requirements (e.g., APA, MLA), word limits, and submission procedures. Ignoring these guidelines is unprofessional and can result in an immediate desk rejection.' },
      { type: 'h2', text: '8. Overstated Claims or Unsubstantiated Conclusions' },
      { type: 'p', text: 'Your conclusions must be directly supported by your data. Exaggerating the importance of your findings or drawing conclusions that are not warranted by the evidence will be flagged by reviewers.' },
      { type: 'h2', text: '9. Ethical Concerns' },
      { type: 'p', text: 'Issues such as plagiarism, data fabrication, or failure to obtain proper ethical clearance for research involving human subjects are major red flags that will lead to immediate rejection and can damage your academic reputation.' },
      { type: 'h2', text: '10. A Simple Lack of Novelty' },
      { type: 'p', text: 'Sometimes, the research is sound but simply not new or interesting enough for a high-impact journal. It might replicate previous work without adding new insights or address a question that is not of broad interest to the journal\'s readership.' },

A dissertation must produce new, original knowledge or theory in the field.

It shows expertise and originality.' },
